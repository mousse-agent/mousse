# Agent platform delivery ledger

## Objective and baseline

Implement the full architecture and parallel plan using Grok CLI workers. Only a verified Grok weekly subscription limit permits the requested GPT-5.6 Luna high/fast fallback. GPT-5.6 Sol medium/fast performs verification, merge and code review. The root agent implements the Liquid Glass Orb without delegation.

Source baseline: 205fab2d3799b347f8709a32b4352933d68d83e0.
Planning commit: 81c7423.
Integration branch: feat/platform-integration.
Integration worktree: C:/Users/bubbl/Documents/Projects/RYSPA/mousse-platform-worktrees/integration.

The original master checkout has pre-existing package.json/package-lock.json/vitest.config.ts/selectiveWorktree.test.ts changes and a dependency cleanup script. They are excluded from this initial clean baseline and remain untouched in the original checkout. Existing mousse-implementation-worktrees branches are outside this delivery. Reconcile the original changes explicitly at final integration.

Node 22.23.2; npm 10.9.8; Git 2.45.1.windows.1; Grok CLI advertises grok-4.6 and grok-4.5; Codex CLI 0.154.0. All worker tests use separate temporary/runtime homes. No live user accounts, channels or browser cookies are test inputs.

## Ownership and initial packages

| Owner | Package | Writable paths | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| root | F00/F01/F02/F03 and orb | Shared registrations/configs/ledgers; src/renderer/components/orb/** | Running |
| Grok profiles | P01/P02 foundation | src/shared/profiles/**, src/mms/profiles/**, tests/platformProfiles*.test.ts, own handoff | Ready |
| Grok workflow | W01 | src/shared/workflows/**, src/mms/workflows/**, tests/platformWorkflow*.test.ts, examples/workflows/**, own handoff | Ready |
| Grok agents/editor | U01/A01 | src/shared/agents/**, src/mms/agentDefinitions/**, src/renderer/components/editors/**, FilesPanel.tsx, tests/platformAgent*.test.ts, tests/platformMarkdown*.test.ts, own handoff | Ready |

The coordinator temporarily assigns initial domain schema authorship to each sole domain worker. Their concrete schema/fixture commit must be reviewed before any consumer uses it. Existing shared aggregate types/protocol/preload/IPC, package manifests, appStore, App.tsx and orchestrator remain root-owned. No worker may implement, redesign or modify the orb.

Worker-process handles and logs are retained under the sibling orchestration directory. A process is considered live only after checking its execution session/process, not merely because a status file says running. Do not restart a worker after a polling timeout without checking the same process.
